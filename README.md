### pypostalcode

`pypostalcode` is a fork of Nathan Van Gheem's excellent `pyzipcode` package. The zipcode database has been replaced with Canadian cities and their postal codes. The general usage is the same.

Canadian postal codes are six characters with this format: `A1A 1A1`, where `A` is a letter and `1` is a digit, with a space separating the third and fourth characters. The first three digits are the Forward Sortation Area (FSA), and the last three are the Local Delivery Unit (LDU). The FSA information is available from the report "Forward Sortation Area Boundary File, 2011 Census. Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 92-179-X" retrieved from
http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2011-eng.cfm

This module only uses the FSA designator for location. There are over 800,000 FSA+LDU combinations, but the 1,645 unique FSA values provide coarse resolution for most applications.

To install:

```
pip install pypostalcode
```

Basic usage:

```pycon
>>> from pypostalcode import PostalCodeDatabase
>>> pcdb = PostalCodeDatabase()
>>> pc = 'V5K'
>>> location = pcdb[pc]
>>> location.postalcode
'V5K'
>>> location.city
'Vancouver (North Hastings- Sunrise)'
>>> location.province
'British Columbia'
>>> location.longitude
-123.0489
>>> location.latitude
49.293
>>> location.timezone
-8.0
>>> location.dst
1
```

Get a list of postal codes given a radius in kilometers:

```pycon
>>> from pypostalcode import PostalCodeDatabase
>>> pcdb = PostalCodeDatabase()
>>> pc = 'T3Z'
>>> radius = 25
>>> results = pcdb.get_postalcodes_around_radius(pc, radius)
>>> for r in results:
...     print(f'{r.postalcode}: {r.city}, {r.province}')
...
